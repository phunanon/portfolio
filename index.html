    <h2>2018-19 - Baker Hughes, a GE company</h2>
    <p>A primarily C# role in the oil & gas industry, with regular collaboration between other industry fields. Due to the nature of the work not much material is available to share. See my CV for the full job description.</p>

        <h2>"Sondex Kernel" - MQTT broker</h2>
        <p>The vision of the software management at the start of my role was to reign-in decades' worth of utilities and software suites to one communication protocol.</p>
        <p>It was decided to use one akin to MQTT, which would be translated to an embed-suitable protocol on-the-fly. I helped architect and test this new platform with their senior engineer. It became the "Sondex Ultracom" platform.</p>
        <p>After development, to begin developing a new Ultracom utility&mdash;however small&mdash;required including up to fifteen .NET libraries. It was required to use ever-evolving boilerplate to operate them. I couldn't tolerate this.</p>
        <p>I was granted the time to investigate solving this issue, and architected what I called the "Kernel." It became the sole dependency on a project, and at runtime would use reflection to orchestrate one communication "daemon" and one or more "modules". The Kernel provided a thin abstraction between the two types of actor, and completely divorced our business logic from our communication logic for any project. It also made "modules" composable between each other, using MQTT. It sincerely was my favourite programming project of all time.</p>

          <p>The screenshot shows the web-app used, controlling and monitoring a caliper tool &ndash; used to measure the diameter and integrity of oil wells. Here the calipers were depressed by hand on one side.</p>

        <p>It's been a dream to have a programmable pocket-PC, and my own programming language. So I am developing with a friend one called Chika. It uses s-expressions, pure functions, and immutable values. Already it has a core library and some basic drivers like OLED and keypad. Soon it will be able to compile itself on Arduino.</p>
